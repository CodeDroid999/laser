# LASER - [**L**]c3 [**AS**]sembl[**ER**]

## Description

Laser is a cross-platform, command-line-based assembler for the LC3 assembly 
language implemented in pure C. Version 2 extends the functionality of LC3Tools 
and LC3Edit through new pseudoops, along with a project assembly mode.

## Installing

Installing is fairly simple as far as terminal apps go. Follow the instructions 
below or read BUILDING.md for instructions on building from source.

### Linux

Currently, the simplest installation method for Linux for now is to build from 
source. Since there are no external dependencies, this process is relatively 
painless.

```c
// todo
```

For a more detailed explanation of these commands, please see BUILDING.md.

### Windows

A precompiled binary for Windows is provided under the releases tab. Adding 
this executable to your windows %PATH will allow you to invoke it in either 
the Windows command prompt or powershell. Alternatively, you can install 
Windows Subsystem Linux and use the Linux instructions to build from source.
