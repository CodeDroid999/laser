# LASER - [**L**]c3 [**AS**]sembl[**ER**]

## Description

An assembler for the LC3 written entirely in C. I've been trying to move away from LC3Edit provided by my university, which is old and hurts my eyes, and an assembler was the last thing I needed LC3Edit for.

### Motivation

The completion of this tool will allow me to do everything LC3-related from VSCode, my editor of choice. Or it would, except that I've already finished the course and am just using this project to practice my C coding. Hopefully someone down the line will appreciate my efforts in creating a command line LC3 assembler.

### Usage

Laser is a command line tool, and is relatively simple one at that. Here is how to use it after installation on your system:

```
	laser usage:
		-v to display version number
		-h to display this message again
		-a followed by a file name to generate a loadable OBJ file
		-c followed by a file name to remove all files generated by '-a'
```

I've got a lot of work to do. Good thing winter break is forever.
